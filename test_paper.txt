Title: Machine Learning Applications in Healthcare

Abstract
This paper reviews recent advances in machine learning applications for healthcare. We examine various approaches and their effectiveness in diagnostic and treatment scenarios.

Introduction
Recent work by Smith et al. (2023) has shown promising results in diagnostic accuracy. Additionally, Johnson et al. (2022) demonstrated improvements in medical image analysis.

Related Work
Machine learning has been widely applied in healthcare. Brown and Davis (2021) reported significant improvements in patient outcomes using deep learning approaches.
